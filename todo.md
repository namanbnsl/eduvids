⚠️ Possible Issues

FadeOut(*self.mobjects)

This can sometimes throw ValueError if no mobjects exist or if self.mobjects is empty.

Safer way:

self.play(FadeOut(VGroup(*self.mobjects)))


Voiceover timing + animations

If an animation runs longer than the voiceover segment, Manim will wait until the animation is done.

If it runs shorter, the scene might freeze until the voiceover ends.

You might want to match animation duration with narration (e.g., self.play(..., run_time=3) if narration is 3 seconds).

LaTeX readability

Some of your formulas (esp. the GAN objective) are wide. In Manim, long MathTex can overflow or shrink badly.

Safer to split into multiple lines or scale down:

math_eq = MathTex(r"V(D,G) = ...", font_size=40)


surrounding_rectangle highlight

You didn’t add one, but if you plan to, remember:

box = SurroundingRectangle(math_eq, color=YELLOW)
self.play(Create(box))


Application placeholders

Circles, squares, and triangles with text are fine, but depending on resolution they may overlap. A VGroup(...).arrange_in_grid(rows=2, cols=2, buff=1) looks cleaner.
