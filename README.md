## üì∫ Setting up automatic YouTube uploads (optional)
1. Visit Google Cloud Console and create an **OAuth desktop service**. Your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` will be available here.

3. Getting your `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`:
```bash
# Visit the auth screen and allow permissions for your YouTube channel. The REFRESH_TOKEN will be visible on the console after that.
node helper/get_google_refresh_token.mjs
```

4. Edit your `YOUTUBE_PRIVACY_STATUS` in `.env` based on what you want as the visibility for your videos `(public | unlisted | private)`. Default is `public`.
