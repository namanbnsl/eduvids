## 🚀 Using the Online Version

1. Open [eduvids](https://eduvids.vercel.app).
2. Enter any topic you’d like explained as a video, or press **Video** and enter the same.
3. Wait while the servers render your video. (You can switch tabs, but don’t close it.)
4. Once ready, the video will appear on the page, and you’ll get a notification.

💡 **Tip:** If you accidentally close the tab or want to revisit your video, check the [eduvids YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@eduvids-ai)—your video will be uploaded there automatically.

## 📺 Setting up automatic YouTube uploads (optional)

3. Getting your `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`:

```bash
# Visit the auth screen and allow permissions for your YouTube channel. The REFRESH_TOKEN will be visible on the console after that.
node helper/get_google_refresh_token.mjs
```

4. Edit your `YOUTUBE_PRIVACY_STATUS` in `.env` based on what you want as the visibility for your videos `(public | unlisted | private)`. Default is `public`.
